Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

For better understanding of project status each team member should update their
status every day. We use `Trello` for tasks tracking:
https://trello.com/b/iP62el3p/travel-platform

Start working
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before doing some work please review list of tasks from `TODO` list.
This is a list of actual tasks to be done.
If tasks was found and some work started on it, status of task
should be updated from `TODO` into `IN PROGRESS`.
If there is no tasks in `TODO` list, please report this issue.

Tracking task status
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Status for each task should be updated. If there are some issues or concerns
they should be highlighted in comments for this task.
If task is blocked by another task, it should be also highlighted.
Task may be moved into `TODO` column if there were some difficulties with it.
Task may be moved into `DONE` column only in case if pull request was created,
approved by reviewers and merged into `release` branch.

Number of active tasks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each team member should work with one or maximum two different tasks
at the same time. New task may be started only after finishing work on
the previous task. It means that previous task was developer, reviewed, merged
and has enough of unittests (if they are needed for implemented task).
