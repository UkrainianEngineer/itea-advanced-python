Before developing something each developer should read and understand
all of these conventions.

Unittests
~~~~~~~~~

Each critical part of business logic should be covered with unittests.
After each of commit all of existing unittests should runs without errors.
If there are some errors, author of commit should fix all the issue.
It's not important if failes their part of code or not.  It should work.
